## Text processing
Python Programming can be used to process text data for the requirements in various textual data analysis. 
A very important area of application of such text processing ability of python is for NLP (Natural Language Processing).

The Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) is a suite of such libraries which provides the functionalities required for NLP.
Below are some applications which use NLP and indirectly python's NLTK.

### Summarization

Many times, we need to get the summary of a news article, a movie plot or a big story. They are all written in human language and without NLP we
have to rely on another human's interpretation and presentation of such summary to us. But with help of NLP we can write programs to use NLTK
and summarize the long text with various parameters, like what is the percentage of text we want in the final output, choosing the positive and
negative words for summarization etc. The online news feeds rely on such summarization techniques to present news insights.

### Voice Based Tools

The voice-based tools like apples Siri or Amazon Alexa rely on NLP to understand the interaction mad with humans. They have a large training
data set of words, sentences and grammar to interpret the question or command coming from a human and process it. Though it is about voice,
indirectly it also gets translated to text and the resulting text form the voice is taken through the NLP system to produce result.

### Information Extraction

Web scrapping is a common example of extracting data form the web pages using python code. Here it may not be strictly NLP based but it does involve
text processing. For example, if we need to extract only the headers present in a html page, then we look for the h1 tag int he page structure
and find a way to extract the text between only those tags. This need text processing program from python.

### Spam Filtering

The spam in emails can be identified and eliminated by analysing the text in the subject line as well as in the content of the message. As the spam
emails are usually sent in bulk to many recipients, even if their subjects and contents have little variation, that can be matched and tagged to mark
them as spam Again it needs the use of the NLTK libraries.

### Language Translation

Computerized language translation relies heavily on NLP. As more and more languages are used in the online platform, it becomes a necessity to
automate the translation from one human language to another. This will involve programming to handle the vocabulary, grammar and context
tagging of the languages involved in translation. Again, NLTK is used to handle such requirements.

### Sentiment Analysis

To find out the overall reaction to the performance of a movie, we may have to read thousands of feedback posts from the audience. But that too
can be automated by using the classification of positive an negative feedback through words and sentence analysis. And then measuring the
frequency of positive and negative reviews to find the overall sentiment of the audience. This obviously needs the analysis of the human language
written by the audience and NLTK is used heavily here for processing the text.
